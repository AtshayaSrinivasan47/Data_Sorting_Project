Uploaing the cleaned dataset for sorting the price, number of reviews, reviews per month variable to find the sorting time of each column.

Powersort Competition 2024, a citizen-scientist competition to collect broader evidence of impact and real-world performance data for the new Python default sorting method

This work is 'part of the competition' leveraged google colab to run the code to find the performance of the sorting algorithm.
Since there is a limited access to virtual machine, I decided to work only on data cleaning and defining function to calculate sorting time using the chosen dataset. To be precise, I imported time and pandas library for doing cleaning and exploration of data.
